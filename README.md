# BasicCrypt
BasicCrypt is an ancient language that compiles into JavaScript.

The dark dictum of BasicCrypt is: "the year is 1975; life is nasty, brutish,
and short."

## Installation
_TBD_

## Example Code

```basic
10 REM LOOP A FAMILIAR GREETING. FOREVER.
20 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
30 GOTO 20
```

## Usage
Assuming you've installed the `basiccrypt` executable globally:

```bash
# run a basic program
basiccrypt hello.bas

# output the BASIC program as Javascript
basiccrypt --print hello.bas
```

## TODO

* Some sort of REPL
